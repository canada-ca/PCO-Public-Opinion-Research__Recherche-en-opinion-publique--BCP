This repository will house the work completed under [GC Developers Exchange contract #1](https://beta.gcdevexchange.org/opportunities/opp-create-accessible-copies-of-reports-and-summary-tables----cr-er-des-copies-accessibles-des-rapports-et-des-tableaux-sommaires).

The work will include translating a sample of POR report files to HTML5 and will include a repeatable process that can be used by GC teams to convert POR report files into HTML5 (the new standard required in order to submit POR reports to Library and Archives Canada).

The work is due to be completed by March 21 and will be done in English and translated into French once complete.

Any questions can be directed to: consultation@pco-bcp.gc.ca
