**Status update:  January 12, 2018**

After cancelling the [POR opportunity](https://beta.gcdevexchange.org/opportunities/opp-create-accessible-copies-of-reports-and-summary-tables----cr-er-des-copies-accessibles-des-rapports-et-des-tableaux-sommaires) on Wednesday January 10, 2018 due to feedback that a solution was not possible, we have uncovered some new information:
  
1. Our reach into the developer community was broader than we thought (beyond the community that was engaging on the repo)
2. A number of developers had prepared proposals (fully or partially). 
3. Some developers submitted proposals despite the cancelled status.
 
The above information has lead us to the realization that cancelling the opportunity was premature and we have decided to re-issue the opportunity.  We have extended the deadline to January 22, 2018. We have not adjusted the scope as we want to fairly look at all the proposals (those submitted already and any that are submitted in the next week).
 
We are extremely grateful to everyone who has commented on and participated in this opportunity and the broader GC Developers Exchange Project.  Working in a rapid, iterative way means we will make mistakes but we are committed to learning from them in order to make improvements.
 
If you have feedback to share that you haven’t already, we want to hear from you!

Blog post to come on lessons learned.  Thanks again everyone.

Thank you for your feedback. It confirmed that in order to make the HTML5 files compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, it is necessary to manipulate the files manually and understand their content. This rules out the development of a simple tool that converts the files automatically.  As such we are cancelling this opportunity.

We will work with Procurement to ensure that, in future, suppliers of Public Opinion Research submit their deliverables in HTML5 format that is compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. We are currently considering options for converting existing Public Opinion Research reports to HTML5 files that are compliant with the Guidelines.

Nous vous remercions de votre rétroaction. Elle a permis de confirmer que pour rendre les fichiers HTML5 conformes aux Règles pour l'accessibilité des contenus Web (WCAG), il est nécessaire de manipuler les fichiers manuellement et de comprendre leur contenu. Cela exclut la possibilité de mettre au point un outil simple qui convertit les fichiers automatiquement. Nous annulons donc cette possibilité de travail contractuel. 

Nous collaborerons avec Approvisionnement pour veiller à ce qu’à l’avenir, les fournisseurs de services de recherche sur l’opinion publique soumettent les produits livrables dans un format HTML5 qui est conforme aux Règles pour l'accessibilité des contenus Web. Nous étudions actuellement des options pour convertir les rapports sur l’opinion publique existants en fichiers HTML5 conformes aux Règles.
