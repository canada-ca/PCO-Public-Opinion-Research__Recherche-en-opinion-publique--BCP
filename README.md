This repository contains the work initially developed under [GC Developers Exchange contract #1](https://beta.gcdevexchange.org/opportunities/opp-create-accessible-copies-of-reports-and-summary-tables----cr-er-des-copies-accessibles-des-rapports-et-des-tableaux-sommaires).

It includes the conversion of a sample of Public Opinion Research (POR) report files to HTML5 to make them more accessible. 

Documentation of a process that can be used by GC teams to convert POR report files into HTML5 (the new standard required to submit POR reports to Library and Archives Canada).

This initial effort is in English. Once complete, translation into French for future users and developers.
