- this appears to be a file created by the LAC repository. I can do a direct fix for any WCAG problems but it is likely another project to properly fix at the source.

- these files are hopelessly complex tables that are tough to describe and converting them to HTML would not be helpful.
The best solution is to archive the raw .csv data and let it be reprocessed in the future if needed.  This is what the Archives recommends. Unfortunately these files are not in a format that can be reduced to CSV format.  Some reference csv files have been referenced that could be used.

- these 2 files are relatively simple tables that can use Technique I to copy them to Excel, use a formula to repair empty cells and the export to .csv.  An HTML representation is also generated and both files could be submitted.

- a tremendously complex multiple worksheet spreadsheet.  Each table is also beyond the WCAG limits of comprehedability, so CSV is the only possible format. It is the output of a very comprehensive analysis program.
The referenced .csv file appears to be raw input and would have to suffice for archive.
