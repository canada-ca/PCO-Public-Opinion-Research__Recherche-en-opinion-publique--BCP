# Technique E: Throw up your hands

## Questionnaire forms

This case occurred in a couple of different forms. One was an appendix that was an html file that was a formatted survey form. This documentation shows how to [extract](embeddedcontent.md) the  html survey.

It is a horrible mess of markup used to make a pretty looking result but, it is very difficult to make it accessible. Throw up your hands and encourage the opinion research companies to find a way to make this simple or accessible.

Another form of the questionnaire shows in [this report](https://canada-ca.github.io/PCO-Public-Opinion-Research__Recherche-en-opinion-publique--BCP/final/030-16-e/reportwordacout.html). Scroll down to the appendix and you will get accessible html but the questions have been flattened so much that they are hard to navigate. I threw up my hands and left it as is for illustration of an area needing improvement earlier in the survey process.

## Complex spreadsheets

One of the files in the dataset:

http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/pwgsc-tpsgc/por-ef/privy_council/2017/030-16-e/data.xlsx

is a tremendously complex multiple worksheet spreadsheet.  Each table is also beyond the WCAG limits of comprehedability, so CSV is the only possible format. It is the output of a very comprehensive analysis program.
The referenced .csv file appears to be raw input and would have to suffice for archive.
