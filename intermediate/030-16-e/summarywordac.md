## Executive Summary 

### Background

The Communications and Consultations Secretariat of the Privy Council Office (PCO) provides advice and support to the Government of Canada, the Clerk of the Privy Council and to departments/agencies on matters relating to communications and consultations, and facilitates the coordination of the Government of Canada's activities in these areas. One tool used in order to fulfil its mandate is public opinion research.

Under this remint, PCO needed to conduct a survey to assess the concerns and the perceptions of Canadians on government priorities, to be conducted in Fall 2016. As complex issues are often difficult to communicate to the Canadian public, it was necessary to assess their views and concerns so communications strategies can be developed to effectively communicate with the public in a manner that can be easily and clearly understood.

The contract value for the research was \$214,669.49, including HST.

### Research Objectives

The research objectives included:

-   To assess the perceptions of Canadians on various government priorities, such as the economy

-   To better understand the views and concerns of the Canadian public which will aid in the development of effective communications strategies and products around complex issues
